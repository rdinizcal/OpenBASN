Experiment for section 4B

- Here we explore three types of datasets to evidence that we tame uncertainties related to task cost and reliability during runtime.
   1) dynamic randomized values for reliability and cost during runtime
   2) static values for reliability and cost simulating engineering guesses for its values
   3) static known values for relibaility and cost

- policy not dealing with uncertainties:

        cost_setpoint = 0.0047;
        reliability_setpoint = 0.9;

- 5 minutes execution for both scenarios

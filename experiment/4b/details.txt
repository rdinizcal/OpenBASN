Experiment for section 4B

- We can explore 4 uncertainty variables in runtime model: costs, reliabilities, frequencies and sensors activation. Though, we will make sure to explore scenarios where we present the controlled system behavior with one or more untamed uncertainties and with all uncertainties tamed. Thus, evidencing that our approach guides the development of controllers with capabilities of taming uncertainties in runtime.

- Our experimentation scenarios are:
   1) approach without taming uncertainties
        2.1) not taming any
        2.2) not taming cost
        2.3) not taming reliability
        2.4) not taming frequencies <-
                2.4.1)
                        We send constant values to the managing system as if the engineer has configured the system with
                        wrong frequencies.
        2.5) not taming active sensors 
   2) approach with taming uncertainties
        3.1) taming all uncertainties <-
        3.2) taming only cost
        3.3) taming only reliability
        3.4) taming only frequencies
        3.5) taming only active sensors

* where taming an uncertainty is to take its real value to runtime model,
  and not taming is by pluggin approximated (or random) values to the model

- adaptation goal:

        cost_setpoint = 0.0047;
        reliability_setpoint = 0.9;

- 3 minutes execution for both scenarios
